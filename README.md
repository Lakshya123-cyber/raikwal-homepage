# My personal website
This is my very own personal portfolio which I made using Next.js (a framework of JS)
As a high-school student I have very limited time to make a website like this for myself but I have tried my best and completed it.

Most of the credit go to the youtubers from whom I have learned loads and have come up this far that I have a website of my own!
